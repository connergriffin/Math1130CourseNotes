\begin{definition}
    A \emph{quadratic equation} in the variable \(x\) is an equation that can be written in the form
    \[ax^2+bx+c=0\]
    where \(a,b,c\) are real numbers and \(a\ne 0.\)
\end{definition}

\begin{question}
    Which of the following are quadratic equations
    \begin{selectAll}
        \choice[correct]{\(x^2+x+1=0\)}
        \choice[correct]{\(w^2=2\)}
        \choice{\(y^2+3y = y^2 +7\)}
    \end{selectAll}
\end{question}

Option \(c\) is not correct since when in the form \(ay^2+by+c=0\) the coefficient of \(y^2\) is \(0.\)
