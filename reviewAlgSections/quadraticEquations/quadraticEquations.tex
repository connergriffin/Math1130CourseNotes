    In this section we will cover several methods for finding solutions to quadratic equations. We will see examples of higher degree polynomial equations may easily be factored.

We have two methods for finding all solutions to a quadratic equation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Method 1] Factoring
    
        This method is quick if the solutions are integers! (\(\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\))
    \item[Method 2] Quadratic formula
    
        Always works. There is a formula to memorize and often there will be some simplification to do.
\end{enumerate}
