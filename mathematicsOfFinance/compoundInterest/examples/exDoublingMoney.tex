\begin{example}
    How long will it take an initial investment to double if you invest at \(9\%\) compounding semiannually?
    \begin{solution}
        The total amount after \(n\) interest periods is given by \(P\left(1+\frac{0.09}{2}\right)^n.\) We want to double \(P.\) Thus we want to solve for \(n\) in the equation
        \[2P = P\left(1.045\right)^n\]
        \begin{gather*}
            2P = P\left(1.045\right)^n \\
            2= \left(1.045\right)^n \\
            \ln\left(2\right) = n\ln\left(1.045\right) \\
            n = \frac{\ln\left(2\right)}{\ln\left(1.045\right)} \\
            n\approx 15.75
        \end{gather*}
        Since this is a semiannual period (a.k.a \(6\) months) we divide \(n\) by \(2\) to get the number of years.
        The initial investment will double after \(7.875\) years.
    \end{solution}
