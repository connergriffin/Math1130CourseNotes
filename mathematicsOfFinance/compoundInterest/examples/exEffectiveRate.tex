\begin{example}
    Find the effective rate that corresponds to the given nominal rate. Round the percentage to \(3\) decimal places.

    \(6\%\) compounded quarterly and \(5.85\%\) compounded daily.
    \begin{solution}
        Quarterly means \(n=4.\) Thus

        \[r_e = \left(1+\frac{0.06}{4}\right)^4-1 = \left(1.015\right)^4-1 \approx0.06136\]

        As a percentage: \(6.136\%\)

        Daily means \(n=365.\) Thus

        \[r_e = \left(1+\frac{0.0585}{365}\right)^{365}-1 \approx 0.06024\]

        As a percentage: \(6.024\%\)

        The \(6\%\) compounded quarterly has a higher effective rate and hence provides more compound amount over a year.
    \end{solution}
