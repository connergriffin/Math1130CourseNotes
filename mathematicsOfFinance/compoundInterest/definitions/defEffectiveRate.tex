Suppose you are interested in investing \(\$1000.\) One account has \(4.5\%\) compounding annually and another has \(3.75\%\) compounding quarterly. We would like to compare the two accounts and determine which will provide the greater return. We may do this using the \emph{effective rate.}

\begin{definition}
    The \emph{effective rate} \(r_e\) that is equivalent to an annual rate of \(r\) compounded \(n\) times a year is given by
    \[r_e = \left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^n-1.\]
\end{definition}
