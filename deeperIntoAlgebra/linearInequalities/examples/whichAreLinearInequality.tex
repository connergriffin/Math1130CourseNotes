\begin{question}
    Which of the following are linear inequalities?
    \begin{selectAll}
        \choice[correct]{\(x-1 < -2\)}
        \choice[correct]{\(y^2-y > y^2+2\)}
        \choice{\(0 \le 2\)}
    \end{selectAll}
\end{question}

Note that to determine if each is a linear inequality, we must apply the rules regarding order reversing and order preserving operations. In the case of \((b)\) we have to be careful. We will have to subtract \(y^2+2\) from both sides. The relevant rule states that for any real number \(c,\) if \(y^2-y > y^2+2\) then \(y^2-y +c >y^2+2 +c.\) In our case \(c = -(y^2+2)\) which is a real number for all possible values of \(y.\) We may freely add it to both sides of the inequality.
