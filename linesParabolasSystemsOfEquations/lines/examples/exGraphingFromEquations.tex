\begin{example}Graphing Linear Equations

    Graph the equation \(x-2y+3=0.\)

    \begin{solution}
        The easiest way to graph a general linear equation is to find the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts and then to draw the straight line between them.

        If \(x=0\) then \(-2y+3=0\) and so \(y=\frac{3}{2}.\)
        The \(y\)-intercept is \(\left(0,\frac{3}{2}\right).\)

        If \(y=0\) then \(x+3=0\) and so \(x=-3.\)

        The \(x\)-intercept is \(\left(-3,0\right).\)
