Every quadratic function has either a maximum or a minimum. If \(a>0\) then it has a minimum and if \(a<0\) it has a maximum. The max or min always occurs at the vertex. We can find the range of any given quadratic function from this max or min.

\begin{question}
    Find the range of the function \(q(p) = 2p^2+3p+1\)
    \begin{solution}
        Since \(a>0,\) the parabola opens upward and the function has a minimum value. The vertex is \(\left(-\frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{8}\right).\) Thee minimum function value attained is \(f\left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}.\) Since we found a minimum value, the range is then \(\big[-\frac{1}{8},\infty\big).\)

\begin{question}
    Find the range of the function \(r(t) = -2t^2+1\)
    \begin{solution}
        Since \(a<0,\) the parabola opens downwards and the function has a maximum value. The vertex is \((0, 1).\) The maximum function value attained is \(f\left(0\right) = 1.\) Since we found a maximum value, the range is then \(\big(-\infty,1\big].\)
