The real numbers \(0\) and \(1\) have an important quality with respect to addition and multiplication. That is for any real number \(a\)
\[a+0 = 0+a = a\]
and
\[a\cdot1=1\cdot a=a.\]

We call \(0\) the additive identity and \(1\) the multiplicative identity. Other operations have identities too! In section we will focus on the identity for function composition. 

\begin{definition}
    For functions from the real line to the real line, \(I(x)=x\) is the \emph{identity function} in that for any function \(f\) from \((-\infty,\infty)\) to \((-\infty,\infty)\) \[\left(f\circ I\right)\left(x\right) = \left(I \circ f\right)\left(x\right) = f\left(x\right)\]
\end{definition}
